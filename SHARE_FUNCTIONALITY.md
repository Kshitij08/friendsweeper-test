# Share Functionality Implementation

## Overview

The Friendsweeper game now includes a share functionality that allows players to cast their game results to Farcaster with a visual representation of their board layout.

## Features

### 1. Share Button
- Added to both Game Over and Win modals
- Opens a preview modal before sharing
- Shows cast text and board layout image

### 2. Cast Text Generation
- **Win**: "Avoided @username1 @username2 @username3... to win 100 points! ðŸŽ‰"
- **Loss**: "Got killed by @username, lost 100 points. ðŸ’¥"

### 3. Board Image Generation
- Creates an SVG representation of the game board
- Shows revealed cells, bombs, and flags
- Displays follower usernames on bomb cells
- Includes game result title (Win/Loss)

- Calls image generation API
- Returns prepared cast data

#### `/api/generate-board-image`

### Components
